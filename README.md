# What is this repo?

For the longest I have been wanting to do the [handmade hero series ](https://guide.handmadehero.org/code/) but I don't have a windows machine. [Handmade penguin's](https://davidgow.net/handmadepenguin/) is a version of that but for linux. The problem is that it only goes until episode 19. I want to do at least 60+ episodes of handmade hero so that won't cut it.

I only know high level programming with scripting languages like python doing data science tasks. I don't know C, nor low level programming concepts like the inner workings of things like Operating Systems and CPU's.

But you know what? Fuck it. I have decided I'm going to do handmade hero on Linux trying my best to translate everything that Casey explains about the `windows OS` and `API` to `Linux's API` and `X11`.

⚠️**DO NOT USE THIS REPO**⚠️ as a reference. This repo is meant for my own learning journey. A documentation of everything I learn about low level programming related to handmade hero and hopefully at the end of this I will have leveled up my coding skills and an executable game.

# Note

The `Languages` section of this repo shows that the language we are using is `C++`, but really we are writing it like if it was `C`.Casey decided to use `.cpp` files because [he wants the `operator` and `function overloading` features of `C++`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxbJo5DDpWY&t=3840), but aside from that he doesn't use other `C++` features and just writes `C`.
